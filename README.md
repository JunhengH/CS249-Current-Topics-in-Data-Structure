## Code Explanation
- Strategy Analytics folder gives intuition on how we decided to do some preprocessing to eliminate useless information. 
 - count_waiting.py: counts the number of waiting instances in a taxi trip. 
 - timeSelection.py: showed a good reason why -3~+1 minutes are meaningful to our trajectory. 
 - visualization.py: generates the Snip20171203_2.png.
 - Snip20171203_2.png: a picture of nearest taxi stand vs the destination count, this provides a good reason that users are likely to visit certain destinations starting from the same nearest taxi stands.
- data folder contains the necessary files used for training and testing our algorithm.
- similarity-based folder contains the code for our baseline model.
